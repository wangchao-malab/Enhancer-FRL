## Enhancer-FRL

### 1 Description
Enhancers are crucial for precisely regulation of gene expression, while enhancers identification and strength prediction is challenging because of their freely distribution and tremendous of similar fractions in genome. Enhancer-FRL, a two-layer predictor proposed for identifying enhancers (enhancers or non-enhancers) and their activities (strong and weak) using the feature representation learning scheme.
